# Building

Here you will find instructions on how to install the necessary tools for building and running the app.

### Prerequisites

- The OS'es supported for building is Ubuntu (20.04) and Fedora (37 - Work In Progress)
- A machine with at least 100 GB of Storage

The following prerequisites can be installed with the setup script [`scripts/setup.sh`](./../scripts/setup.sh) or manually as described below:

- Flutter 3.7.11 [(install manually or with git, do not install with snap)](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK Requirement (>=2.19.0, up until <3.0.0) (normally included with a flutter install)
- Android setup ([Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and subsequent dependencies)

### Scripted setup

[`scripts/setup.sh`](./../scripts/setup.sh) is provided as a tool to set up installation for building: download the script and run it anywhere.  This script should skip the entire [Manual setup](#manual-setup) section below and prepare you for [running](#running).  It will set up the stack_wallet repository in `~/projects/stack_wallet` and build it there. 

### Manual setup

> If you have installed with script, skip to [running](#running) 

Please go to your Linux distribution's title below for instructions on how to manually setup:

- [Ubuntu (20.04)](#ubuntu-2004)
- [Fedora (37) (Work In Progress)](#fedora-37-work-in-progress)

#### Ubuntu (20.04)

Install basic dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev curl unzip automake build-essential file pkg-config git python libtool libtinfo5 cmake libgit2-dev clang libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev zlib1g-dev llvm python3-distutils
```

The following *may* be needed for Android studio:
```
sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386
```

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) with command:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install 1.67.1
rustup default 1.67.1
```

Install the additional components for Rust:
```
cargo install cargo-ndk --version 2.12.7
```
Android specific dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```
Linux desktop specific dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev meson python3-pip libgirepository1.0-dev valac xsltproc docbook-xsl
pip3 install --upgrade meson==0.64.1 markdown==3.4.1 markupsafe==2.1.1 jinja2==3.1.2 pygments==2.13.0 toml==0.10.2 typogrify==2.0.7 tomli==2.0.1
```

After installing the prerequisites listed above, download the code and init the submodules
```
git clone https://github.com/cypherstack/stack_wallet.git
cd stack_wallet
git submodule update --init --recursive

```

Run prebuild script

```
cd scripts
./prebuild.sh
// when finished go back to the root directory
cd ..
```

Remove pre-installed system libraries for the following packages built by cryptography plugins in the crypto_plugins folder: `boost iconv libjson-dev libsecret openssl sodium unbound zmq`.  You can use
```
sudo apt list --installed | grep boost
```
for example to find which pre-installed packages you may need to remove with `sudo apt remove`.  Be careful, as some packages (especially boost) are linked to GNOME (GUI) packages: when in doubt, remove `-dev` packages first like with
```
sudo apt-get remove '^libboost.*-dev.*'
```
<!-- TODO: configure compiler to prefer built over system libraries. Should already use them? -->

Building plugins for Android 
> Warning: This will take a long time, please be patient
```
cd scripts/android/
./build_all.sh
// when finished go back to the root directory
cd ../..
```

Building plugins for Linux

```
cd scripts/linux/
./build_all.sh
// when finished go back to the root directory
cd ../..
```

#### Fedora (37) (Work In Progress)

This is a work in progress, please use Ubuntu for now.

## Running
### Android
Plug in your android device or use the emulator available via Android Studio and then run the following commands:
```
flutter pub get
flutter run android
```

Note on Emulators: Only x86_64 emulators are supported, x86 emulators will not work

### Linux
Plug in your android device or use the emulator available via Android Studio and then run the following commands:
```
flutter pub get Linux
flutter run linux
```

## Android Studio
Android Studio is the recommended IDE for development, not just for launching on Android devices and emulators but also for Linux desktop development. 

Follow instructions here [https://developer.android.com/studio/install#linux](https://developer.android.com/studio/install#linux) or install via snap:
```
# setup android studio
sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk
sudo snap install android-studio --classic
```

Use Tools > SDK Manager to install the SDK Tools > Android SDK (API 30), SDK Tools > NDK, SDK Tools > Android SDK command line tools, and SDK Tools > CMake

Then install the Flutter plugin and restart the IDE.  In Android Studio's options for the Flutter language, enable auto format on save to match the project's code style.  If you have problems with the Dart SDK, make sure to run `flutter` in a terminal to download it (use `source ~/.bashrc` to update your environment variables if you're still using the same terminal from which you ran `setup.sh`)

Make a Pixel 4 (API 30) x86_64 emulator with 2GB of storage space for emulation
